# Video Player Library Project Proposal

## 1. Project Description

### Overview
The Video Player Library is a modern web application designed to provide a seamless interface for browsing and playing local video files through a browser-based platform. The project aims to create a sophisticated video management system that allows users to access their local video collection through an intuitive web interface, with a particular focus on developing and experimenting with custom video player implementations.

### Comparison to Existing Solutions
While there are various media players available (VLC, Windows Media Player, QuickTime), and web-based video platforms (YouTube, Vimeo), this project differentiates itself by:
- Focusing on local file access with a web-based interface
- Providing a platform for video player experimentation and customization
- Maintaining privacy by keeping content local rather than cloud-based
- Offering a modern, responsive web interface for video library management

### Key Features
1. Video Library Browser
   - Directory-based video file discovery
   - Thumbnail generation for video previews
   - Grid-based layout with responsive design
   - Search and filtering capabilities

2. Custom Video Player
   - Standard playback controls (play, pause, seek, volume)
   - Advanced features (playback speed, frame-by-frame navigation)
   - Customizable player themes and layouts
   - Support for various video formats
   - Keyboard shortcuts for enhanced usability

3. Technical Features
   - Real-time directory scanning
   - Efficient video streaming from local files
   - Metadata extraction and display
   - Responsive design for various screen sizes

### Technical Requirements
- Hardware:
  - Modern web browser
  - Sufficient storage for video files
  - Recommended: 8GB RAM minimum
  - Processor capable of video decoding

- Software:
  - Next.js framework
  - Node.js runtime
