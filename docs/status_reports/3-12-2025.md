# HLS Implementation Status Report - March 12, 2025

## Summary

The team has made significant progress on the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) implementation. We have successfully developed the video conversion functionality, which represents a major milestone in our adaptive bitrate streaming project. While there are still some issues to resolve with the HLS playback, the conversion infrastructure is now in place and functioning.

## Accomplishments

### Video Conversion Pipeline
- ✅ Implemented FFmpeg-based conversion of standard video files to HLS format
- ✅ Created API endpoint for on-demand video conversion
- ✅ Added support for multiple quality levels (1080p, 720p, 480p)
- ✅ Implemented progress tracking during conversion
- ✅ Optimized bitrate calculation based on resolution and frame rate
- ✅ Added manifest file generation for adaptive streaming

### Infrastructure
- ✅ Set up HLS API endpoint for serving manifest files and video segments
- ✅ Implemented security measures to prevent directory traversal
- ✅ Added proper MIME type handling for different file types
- ✅ Implemented caching headers for improved performance

### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation of the HLS implementation
- ✅ Documented architecture, data flow, and technical details
- ✅ Identified known issues and limitations

## Current Challenges

1. **HLS Playback Bug**: There is currently an issue with the HLS playback functionality that prevents the player from properly streaming the converted files.
2. **Integration with Video Player**: The integration between the conversion process and the video player needs refinement.
3. **Error Handling**: More robust error handling is needed for edge cases during conversion and playback.

## Next Sprint Goals

For the next sprint, our primary focus will be on:

1. **Fix HLS Playback**: Resolve the current bug in the HLS playback functionality to enable proper streaming of converted files.
2. **Implement Adaptive Bitrate Streaming**: Complete the implementation of adaptive bitrate streaming to dynamically adjust video quality based on network conditions.
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Improve the UI for conversion progress and quality selection.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the loading and buffering of HLS content.
5. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and network conditions.

## Technical Approach for Next Sprint

1. Debug the current HLS.js integration to identify and fix playback issues
2. Implement proper event handling for quality switching
3. Add bandwidth monitoring and reporting
4. Improve buffer management to prevent playback interruptions
5. Add quality selection UI for manual override of automatic quality selection

## Conclusion

The successful implementation of the video conversion functionality represents a significant step forward in our adaptive streaming project. With the conversion pipeline in place, we now have a solid foundation to build upon for the next sprint. The team is confident that we can resolve the current playback issues and deliver a fully functional adaptive bitrate streaming solution in the next iteration.
